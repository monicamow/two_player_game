Two Player Math Game

Create a 2-player guessing game where players take turns to answer simple addition problems. The math questions are automatically generated by the game. It should do this by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.

Example prompt: "Player 1: What does 5 plus 3 equal?"

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. If a player gets a question wrong, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.

As before, you can use gets.chomp to get input from users and puts for output.

Please read all of the tips prior to starting your game.

      initialize game
      initialize lives (score)

  run game loop    
      user1 is prompted & game is running
        puts a random math question using integers 1-20

        if user1 answer = true
          puts another random question
        else
          deduct life
          output new lives/scores
        end

      user 2 is promoted 
        puts a random math question using integers 1-20

      if user2 answer = true
        puts another random question
      else
        deduct life
        output new lives/scores
      end

      end game if user1 or user 2 lives = 0
      puts "(user) won"
      puts other player's score

  end
